# Dimensionality reduction of Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset using principal component analysis

This notebook illustrates the application of PCA to the UCI Wisconsin breast cancer dataset in order to reduce to 2 dimensions, for visualisation if possible. 

We scaled the dataset then applied PCA to obtain reduced dimensions.  We mapped target classifications (by colour) to the reduced representation and it apeared that the reduced representation would be largely (linearly) separable with respect to our target categories.

We also used a heatmap to assess the relative importance of all our original features in the 2 PCA components.

Finally, we considered how much of the total variance was explained by each of our principal components.

(Section 3 Exploratory data analysis is a duplicate of similar section in my github repo https://github.com/s-miller/Breast-cancer-biopsy-diagnosis-using-SVM-classifier.git which uses the same dataset.)
