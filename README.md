# Dimensionality reduction of Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset using principal component analysis

This notebook illustrates the application of PCA to the UCI Wisconsin breast cancer dataset in order to reduce to 2 dimensions for visualisation if possible. 

We scaled the dataset then applied PCA to obtain reduced dimensions.  We mapped target to the reduced representation and it appaered that the data would be largely (linearly) separable.

We also used a heatmap to assess the relative contribution of features to the 2 PCA components to see which played the most importance.

Finally, we considered how much of the total variance was explained by each of our 2 principal components.

(Section 3 Exploratory data analysis is a duplicate of similar section in my github repo https://github.com/s-miller/Breast-cancer-biopsy-diagnosis-using-SVM-classifier.git which uses the same dataset.)
